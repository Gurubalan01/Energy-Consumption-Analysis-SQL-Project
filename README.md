📊 **Energy Consumption Analysis - SQL Project**

This project focuses on analyzing global energy patterns using SQL. It explores relationships between energy production, consumption, GDP, population, and emissions across countries and over time. The project uses advanced SQL techniques to generate meaningful insights that support data-driven decision-making.

🔍 **Project Objective**

The main goals of this project include:

🏗 Build a structured relational database for energy-related metrics

🔎 Query & analyze country-wise and year-wise energy data

📈 Compare and evaluate emissions, GDP growth, and energy usage

🧮 Calculate key ratios like per-capita consumption & energy-to-GDP efficiency

💡 Generate actionable insights on global energy trends

🗂 **Dataset & ER Diagram**

The project is built around multiple interconnected tables:

Country (Main reference table)

GDP - yearly GDP values

Population - country population by year

Emissions - CO₂-based emissions by energy type

Production - energy production across types

Consumption - energy consumption across types

Relationship type: Mostly one-to-many (country → yearly records)

(See ER Diagram - Page 4)

📌 **Key Insights**
🌍 **1. Emission Concentration**

Emissions are dominated by a few countries such as China, USA, and India.

⚡ **2. Energy Imbalance**

Some countries produce more energy than they consume (e.g., Australia, Canada), while others depend heavily on imports.

📉 **3. Rising Global Emissions**

Year-over-year emissions show a steady upward trend, especially post-2020.

👥 **4. Per-Capita Variation**

Developed countries exhibit much higher per-person consumption.

💰 **5. GDP–Emission Link**

Higher economic activity strongly correlates with higher emissions.
